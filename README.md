Code Refactoring Challenge
The Fix My Code Challenge introduces a unique project approach where the focus is on delving into an existing codebase and rectifying issues. The process involves utilizing pre-written repositories as initial files for all solutions, emphasizing the improvement of existing code rather than the creation of new code.

This challenge was presented by ALX as part of the curriculum, requiring participants to tackle debugging tasks across a range of programming languages. The languages covered included C, Python, Javascript, Ruby, and more, presenting a diverse set of challenges that tested both familiar and unfamiliar territories.

The project encompasses various tasks, with the first one detailed in the directory 0x00. Fix my code.
